# HousePricing
Machine Learning project to study various parameters and predict the price of a house in a given region.

This is a simple dataset which could be solved easily using linear regression. 
For extended brainstorming and to understand implementation of other ML algorithms, the same dataset has been subjected to elastic net regression, ridge regression and lasso regression.

The respective implementations can be found in the files having corresponding names.
